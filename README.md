# Support Open Internet for everyone withÂ a Tor proxy

What is Open Internet? For me Open Internet is that all people on the world have access to all (legal) content and services which are provided over the Internet. 

The governments in many countries are filtering content and blocking services for their people. So how could we help those people to get access to services and content outside their country? I asked this question myself and found the https://www.torproject.org/ project. I heard a lot about Tor in the past. But never tried it. So let's give it a try.

I like architecture drawings. So let's start with a picture to give an overview of the system.
